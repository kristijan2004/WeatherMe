WeatherMe is my first Javascript web application where I am using the OpenWeather API to fetch the cities weather information and display them into the browser.
In the application the user can read the city temprature, humidity, wind speed, high/low temprature and the current date. Also, the user can choose between 
English(EN) and Macedonian(MK) language same as the temprature units Celsius(C) and Fahrenheit(F). In future my plan is to add 7 days weather forecast and 
implement Typescript into the application.
